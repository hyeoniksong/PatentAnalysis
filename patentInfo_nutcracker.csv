3662799,1972,NUT CRACKING APPARATUS,"Apparatus for cracking nuts, without crushing the kernels thereof, having a fixed plate with a cutting blade and a rotatable wheel adjacent the plate and having radially arranged cutting blades cooperable with the blade of the plate, the side of the wheel adjacent the plate being in the shape of a shallow frustum, so that the space between the plate and the wheel comprises an operating compartment or chamber. The nuts are fed to the chamber one at a time and, at the bottom of this chamber, the nuts are cracked between the blade of the plate and one of the blades of the wheel. The nuts are cut and twisted by the blades so that the kernels are freed whole and the shells and kernels fall from the operating chamber to a receptacle therefor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION . Field of the Invention The invention relates generally to a machine or apparatus for cracking the shells of nuts and relates more particularly to apparatus for mass cracking of nuts without crushing or breaking the meat of the nuts. Description of the Prior Art Various types of nut cracking apparatus have been proposed but these operate on the principle of crushing the shells. Such crushing of the shells tends to also crush or break up the kernels of the nuts. The commercial value of broken or crushed nut kernels is greatly reduced, top prices being paid for whole nut kernels. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a stationary plate having a sharp cutting blade projecting somewhat from the face of the plate. Next to the plate is a rotatable wheel having a shallow frustum-shaped side facing the plate and adjacent thereto. The diameter of the wheel is approximately twice the height of the plate and the wheel has a plurality of sharp radial blades adapted to cooperate with the blade of the plate in cracking nuts. The space between the wheel and the plate comprises an operating chamber that narrows toward the bottom. Shells and nut kernels drop into a receptacle after the nuts have been cracked, the blades cooperating to crack and twist the nuts to effectively crack the shells without crushing or breaking the kernels. A sprocket-like feeder wheel feeds nuts one at a time from a hopper into the operating chamber, at the lower end of which the nuts are cracked. Since the operating chamber narrows toward the lower end, the apparatus automatically handles, within predetermined limits, nuts of various sizes so that it is not necessary to size or sort the nuts prior to putting them in the hopper of the apparatus. The invention is, also, very effective in cracking twins and/or odd or irregularly shaped nuts which often clog up grader apparatus. The present apparatus takes care of such nuts without their being previously graded, thereby eliminating the problem. The characteristics and advantages of the invention are further sufficiently referred to in connection with the following detailed description of the accompanying drawings which represent one embodiment. After considering this example skilled persons will understand that many variations may be made without departing from the principles disclosed and I contemplate the employment of any structures, arrangements or modes of operation that are properly within the scope of the appended claims."
